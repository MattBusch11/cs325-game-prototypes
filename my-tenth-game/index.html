<h2>Open Ocean</h2>

<h1>Game made in Unity. Link here: <a href="Build">Open Ocean</a></h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is about navigating the ocean while avioding obstacles in your path.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I have three different obstacle types, each with their own unique movement styles. One goes straight down, one zigzags and another moves down then side to side then down again. They spawn at random intervals that increase in frequency the longer the game goes on.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This iteration I included an enemy ship that can shoot at the player and allowed the player to shoot back. I increased my learning of cooldowns on actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created all assets except the background which I got from th Unity asset store.
<ul>
<li>Background: <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/five-seamless-tileable-ground-textures-57060">Water Background</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For this iteration I added in an enemy type that spawns in, goes to a position and remains there and coninuously fires on the player at a set interval. I have added the ability for the player to fire a cannon ball straight ahead
in order to fight off the enemies. I created and added sprites for the enemies and cannonballs as well.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate the treacherous ocean and beware the dangers that will sink you!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
An infinite runner mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have to think ahead about where they need to navigate their ship in order to survive for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move up, down, left, and right in order to avoid the obstacles that come from the top of the screen. The player can now also press the spacebar to fire a cannon ball to dispatch pirates.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The obstacles will spawn and move faster as the game progresses so they will need to plan out their path and adapt as new obstacles spwan. Pirates will spawn and remain until the player takes them out. They will continuosly fire on the player,
so the player will need to navigate to a firing position on them and take them out as soon as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player must sail the ocean and avoid crashing into any obstacles and avoid pirates gunfire.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game is all ages, casual market.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game will take as long as the player can survive, probably on average a couple minutes or so.
</li>
