<h2>Open Ocean</h2>

<h1>Game made in Unity. Link here: <a href="Build">Open Ocean</a></h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is about navigating the ocean while avioding obstacles in your path.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I have three different obstacle types, each with their own unique movement styles. One goes straight down, one zigzags and another moves down then side to side then down again. They spawn at random intervals that increase in frequency the longer the game goes on.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I increased my understanding of unique movement for objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created all assets except the background which I got from th Unity asset store.
<ul>
<li>Background: <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/five-seamless-tileable-ground-textures-57060">Water Background</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say this game resembles an infinite runner game such as temple or an even closer one would be flappy bird.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate the treacherous ocean and beware the dangers that will sink you!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
An infinite runner mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have to think ahead about where they need to navigate their ship in order to survive for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move up, down, left, and right in order to avoid the obstacles thatcome from the top of the screen.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The obstacles will spawn and move faster as the game progresses so they will need to plan out their path and adapt as new obstacles spwan.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player must sail the ocean and avoid crashing into any obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game is all ages, casual market.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game will take as long as the player can survive, probably on average a couple minutes or so.
</li>
