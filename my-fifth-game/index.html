<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game takes place on a microscopic level where you fight off COVID-19 virus cells.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I have many enemy objects chasing after the player that will be destroyed by a laser the player can shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to set up a main menu and cycle back to it after the game. I also learned how to make objects chase after another.
The hardest part of making it was setting up the different classes to work together. Took me a bit to figure that out.
The easiest part was setting up scoring as I had that from a previous project.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed all assets. The enemies are bombs from Phaser tutorial and the ship and laser were from another site.
<ul>
<li>Enemies: <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">Enemies</a></li>
<li>Ship: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/gsymlxluw1eve8n/P3SpaceShooterContent.zip/file">Ship and Laser</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say that this game resembles Galaga mostly. I used a tutorial to make this game and some of my code is borrowed from that tutorial.
<li>Tutorial: <a href="https://learn.yorkcs.com/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/">Tutorial</a></li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fight of the deadly COVID-19 Virus cells lest you contract the disease!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the Cleaning theme for this project.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used direct input, a lot of randomness, and a competitor playstyle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A survival shooter mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I am trying to make the player feel as if they are fighting off impossible odds and surviving for as long as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move up, down left, and right by pressing the W, A, S, and D keys respectively. They can also shoot lasers to kill enemies by pressing the spacebar. The player will need to move to both avoid enemies and line up shots to kill them. The enemies will spawn at the top of the
scene and make their way towards the player once the player is within a certain distance. If they touch the player the player dies and must start over. The goal is for the player to accrue as many points as they can by shooting enemies.
Stroy wise the player is fighting off COVID-19 cells and trying to prevent becoming infected.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect kiting the enemies around the player will prove effective at keeping them at a shootable range.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player has just been sprayed from disinfectant onto a surface with COVID-19. The player must eradicate the COVID-19 cells but there are just too many. The player must do its duty to kill as much COVID-19 as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game is all ages, casual market.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game will take as long as the player can survive, probably on average a couple minutes or so.
</li>
